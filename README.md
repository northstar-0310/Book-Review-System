## ‚úÖ Design Decisions & Assumptions

- JWT authentication is used for all protected endpoints.
- Passwords are hashed using **bcrypt** before saving.
- One review per user per book (enforced in business logic).
- Only review owner can update or delete their review.
- Pagination is supported for books and reviews.
- Error handling uses appropriate HTTP status codes/messages.
- MongoDB with **Mongoose** (no SQL/relational features).
- No file uploads (e.g., book covers/avatars) in this version.
- Simple case-insensitive search by title or author.

- A **Book** can have many **Reviews**.
- Each **Review** belongs to one **Book** and one **User**.
- Each **User** can only review a **Book** once.
